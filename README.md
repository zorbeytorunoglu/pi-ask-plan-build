# Pi Plan & Build

**Ask or plan safely, approve explicitly, then implement here or in a clean session.**

A [Pi coding agent](https://github.com/earendil-works/pi-mono) extension that separates planning from implementation without making every small fix a formal project.

- Persistent **Ask/Plan/Build** modes and one current unfinished plan.
- **Ask** answers questions read-only: file mutators and plan lifecycle tools are removed from the active set, so it cannot change code or plan files.
- Complete plan review before implementation, with a clean-session option.
- Optional step-by-step execution—with or without a sidebar.
- Interactive questions, explicit completion, and outstanding validation tracking.
- Optional remembered model/thinking selections for each mode.

## Install

Requires **Pi 0.84.2+** and a **TUI or RPC client** for interactive questions and approval.

```bash
pi install npm:@janvitos/pi-plan-build
# Or:
pi install git:github.com/janvitos/pi-plan-build
```

Restart Pi or run `/reload`. Do not load multiple npm/Git/local copies simultaneously.

## Quick start

1. Start in **Build** for ordinary coding and discussion. Small fixes need no plan.
2. Select **Plan** with `/plan`, or cycle to it with `Alt+M` or editor `Tab`. Explore and discuss; entering Plan does not create a task or write a file. Plan entry is user-controlled—the agent cannot route a Build request into Plan.
3. Ask for a plan or accept a concrete proposed change. The agent investigates, saves the plan, and presents it for review. Accepting scope does **not** authorize implementation.
4. Choose **implement here**, **start fresh and implement**, or **step by step**. Choose **stay in Plan** or press Escape to stop and wait.
5. After implementation and required checks, the agent records completion. Essential user-only validation keeps the plan open with clear instructions; optional feedback does not block completion.

Select **Ask** with `/ask`, by cycling `Alt+M` past Plan, or with `pi --ask` for a question-only session. Ask answers and investigates with no file editors and no plan lifecycle tools, so it cannot create a plan, write one, or change code. Ask your question there, then switch to Plan only when you want the deliverable.

One plan stays current through discussion, mode changes, and revisions. Complete it or explicitly abandon it before starting another. Abandonment preserves the file but does not imply success or allow resumption. A successful clean-session handoff instead marks the source record transferred and moves it to history; only the destination copy remains open.

## Commands and shortcuts

| Action | Purpose |
| --- | --- |
| `Alt+M` | Cycle Build, Plan, and Ask globally |
| `Tab` | Cycle in the custom composer when autocomplete is closed; accept a suggestion when open |
| `/plan` / `/build` / `/ask` | Select a mode |
| `pi --plan` | Start in Plan for one run |
| `pi --build` | Start in Build for one run |
| `pi --ask` | Start in read-only Ask for one run |
| `/plan new` | Start a plan when none is unfinished |
| `/plan list` | Show the current plan's brief status |
| `/plan show` | Read the current plan, progress, and outstanding validation |
| `/plan history` | Read completed, abandoned, and transferred plans tracked on this session branch |
| `/plan done` | Explicitly mark work complete in Build |
| `/plan abandon` | Confirm abandonment without deleting the plan file |
| `/build-fresh` | Retry a pending approved clean-session handoff |
| `/plan-settings` | Configure the default mode, shortcuts, titles, and per-mode model/thinking memory |

Lifecycle and inspection commands require an idle agent. `/plan show` and `/plan history` do not require a model turn or start implementation.

## Settings

Open `/plan-settings`:

| Setting | Default | Behavior |
| --- | --- | --- |
| Default mode | Build | Startup mode for new sessions (Build, Plan, or Ask); the current session is unchanged |
| Shortcuts | Tab + Alt+M | Open its submenu to choose Alt+M only, disable shortcuts, or configure custom keys; reload to apply |
| Plan title | On | Show the current task's title in the composer; applies immediately |
| Per-mode model/thinking | Off | Remember separate Ask, Plan, and Build selections; applies immediately |
| Question tool | On | Provide this extension's structured `question` tool; off leaves a `question` tool from another extension alone; reload to apply |

When per-mode memory is enabled, use Pi's normal model picker and thinking controls in each mode. Switching modes restores that mode's last pair. Disabling leaves the current selection unchanged.

**Tab tradeoff:** the default replaces Pi's closed-menu file-completion trigger. Choose **Alt+M only** to restore it.

Configuration lives at `~/.pi/agent/pi-plan-build.json` (or `$PI_CODING_AGENT_DIR/pi-plan-build.json`). Direct file edits require `/reload`; malformed JSON is never overwritten by settings saves.

## Screenshots

### Plan

![Pi Plan mode composer](docs/images/plan.png)

### Build

![Pi Build mode composer](docs/images/build.png)

The composer shows mode, model, provider, and thinking level. Plan titles are optional; submitted prompts retain their original mode-colored rail.

### Step-by-step execution

![Pi step-by-step plan execution panel](docs/images/step-by-step.png)

Say **“Proceed”** to start a ready step. The agent implements that step, verifies it, and waits before the next. Use ordinary prompts to pause, resume, revise, or skip; use `/plan show` to inspect progress.

The optional sidebar needs fullscreen TUI and at least **132 columns**. Step execution also works in regular/narrow TUI and RPC without it.

## Important limits

- **Plan is not a sandbox.** Path-bearing `edit`, `write`, `replace`, `insert`, and `undo_last_change` calls are restricted to the attached canonical plan file; recognized pathless editors are blocked because their target cannot be verified. Bash/powershell and unknown tools still rely on read-only guidance—not comprehensive mutation enforcement.
- **Ask is read-only at the tool surface, not a sandbox.** Ask removes the recognized file mutators from the active set, so they cannot be called, and blocks them plus plan lifecycle tools at call time. `bash`/`powershell` stay active under read-only guidance because Pi has no sandbox and read-only inspection needs them; unknown or private tools from other extensions stay outside any enforceable boundary. Ask writes no plans and produces no durable artifacts.
- **Build protects tracked plan files** from recognized path-bearing editor calls. Opaque editors that resolve targets through private extension state cannot be preflighted without Pi capability metadata. Completion is recorded separately; guarded step-instruction revisions remain supported.
- **Host tool choices are preserved.** Mode refreshes add only Plan Build’s own tools; they do not restore stale runtime removals or force-enable built-in editors replaced by another extension.
- **Manual mid-run mode changes are deferred.** The composer shows the selected mode while the current run retains its effective permissions. Automatic per-mode model switching is deferred too.
- **Approval checks freshness during the review dialog**, not ongoing implementation drift. Separate deployment/restart approvals still apply.
- **Verification summaries are reports, not harness-certified proof.** Missing summaries do not mean checks passed.
- If another extension owns the editor or fullscreen layout, optional UI degrades rather than replacing it. Core workflows remain available.

## Attribution and license

Independent of Pi and OpenCode. Conversational read-only planning follows OpenCode's Plan agent; persisted finalization/approval are Pi adaptations. Earlier semantics were informed by OpenCode 1.18.16 and clean-session handoffs by the former `pi-plan-mode` extension. No bundled subagents are required.
