# Settings and shortcuts

[← README](../README.md)

## Default startup mode

Build is the default startup mode for new sessions. To start new sessions in Plan or Ask instead, choose **Default mode → Plan** or **Default mode → Ask (read-only)** in `/plan-settings`, or set `defaultMode` directly:

```json
{
  "defaultMode": "plan"
}
```

Only `"build"`, `"plan"`, and `"ask"` are accepted; any other value warns and falls back to Build. **Default mode** applies to sessions that have no mode recorded on their branch, so it takes effect immediately for the next session without `/reload` and never changes the current session's mode. Override it for a single run with `pi --plan`, `pi --build`, or `pi --ask`.

Startup mode resolves in this order:

1. The mode recorded on the session branch.
2. The `--plan` / `--build` / `--ask` CLI flag (`--plan` wins over `--build`, which wins over `--ask`, if several are passed).
3. The `defaultMode` setting.
4. Build.

Restoring or forking a session therefore keeps its recorded mode, and `/reload` is only needed after editing the file by hand.

## Per-mode model and thinking selection

In `/plan-settings`, choose **Per-mode model/thinking → On** to remember separate Ask, Plan, and Build selections. This is **off by default**. Continue using Pi's normal model picker and thinking controls in each mode; switching modes restores that mode's last pair.

Enabling seeds any missing pair from the current model/thinking level. Disabling leaves the current selection unchanged and retains saved pairs for later use. Preferences are global in `pi-plan-build.json` under `modeSelections`; session restoration preserves the session's actual selection. Direct configuration edits require `/reload`.

Manual mode changes during a run defer automatic model switching until that run settles. Fresh implementation uses the remembered Build pair when enabled. Missing models/authentication produce a warning rather than a silent substitution; select a replacement or disable the feature. Agent-initiated mode transitions stop on selection failure. Pi clamps thinking to supported levels and an adjustment notice explains the effective value.

```json
{
  "modeSelections": {
    "enabled": true,
    "plan": { "provider": "your-provider", "modelId": "your-plan-model", "thinkingLevel": "high" },
    "build": { "provider": "your-provider", "modelId": "your-build-model", "thinkingLevel": "medium" },
    "ask": { "provider": "your-provider", "modelId": "your-ask-model", "thinkingLevel": "low" }
  }
}
```

## Question tool

Pi Plan Build provides the structured `question` tool. It is **on by default**; choose **Question tool → Off** in `/plan-settings`, or set it directly:

```json
{
  "questionTool": false
}
```

The setting is read once when the extension loads. `/plan-settings` saves the new value and asks you to run `/reload`; the current session keeps the tool set it started with, because Pi cannot unregister a tool that is already registered. Only `true` and `false` are accepted; any other value warns and stays enabled. Direct file edits require `/reload` too.

With the setting off, a `question` tool supplied by another extension is an ordinary host tool: it is not managed, not filtered out of the mode tool set, and stays available. One API limit follows. Pi requires tool names to be unique across extensions: with the setting **on** and another extension already providing `question`, Pi fails to load this plugin's extension (`Tool "question" conflicts with ...`) while the other extension keeps working — write `"questionTool": false` to run both. Pi has no unregister call, so the setting can only decide what happens at load time; that is why a saved change needs `/reload`. Starting Pi with `"questionTool": false` already written leaves a host `question` tool untouched.

The cancelled-question notice renderer stays registered either way, so entries recorded in earlier sessions keep rendering.

## Shortcut configuration

`/plan-settings` groups **Tab + Alt+M**, **Alt+M only**, **Disabled**, and **Custom (edit config file)** under the **Shortcuts** submenu. The main menu also offers **Default mode**, **Plan title**, **Question tool**, and **Per-mode model/thinking**. Saving preserves unrelated settings; cancellation changes nothing. Malformed JSON is never overwritten. Shortcut changes require `/reload`; the question tool is read at load time, so `/plan-settings` saves it and asks for `/reload`; default mode, title, and per-mode selection changes apply without reloading. Direct file edits require `/reload`.

Pi Plan Build reads `~/.pi/agent/pi-plan-build.json` (or `$PI_CODING_AGENT_DIR/pi-plan-build.json`):

```json
{
  "shortcuts": {
    "toggleMode": ["alt+m"],
    "toggleModeInEditor": ["tab"]
  }
}
```

Both shortcuts cycle Build → Plan → Ask → Build. `/ask`, `/plan`, and `/build` select a mode directly.

Composer-outline plan titles are **on by default**. Choose **Plan title → Off** in `/plan-settings` to hide them immediately, or **On (default)** to show them again; changes save and apply without reloading extensions. If you edit `"showPlanTitle": true` directly in `pi-plan-build.json`, run `/reload` to load that file change. The preference also controls fallback status titles. Enabled composer titles use **regular-weight, warning-colored text with their original capitalization**, right-aligned on the top outline with one blank cell before the corner. Saved titles, other title displays, validation labels, and user input keep their original lettering. Agents are guided to write action-led titles: one imperative phrase naming the action, its object, and at most a short goal (for example `Add color to the composer`). Additional requirements and detail belong in scope. The former `smallCapsPlanTitle` setting is ignored and can be removed from existing configuration files.

Each action accepts one Pi key string or an array. `[]` disables it; omitted actions retain defaults. `toggleMode` uses Pi’s global shortcut conflict rules. `toggleModeInEditor` requires the custom composer and yields to open autocomplete. Both cycle Build → Plan → Ask → Build, wrapping at the end. For example, use `"toggleMode": "ctrl+alt+m"` and `"toggleModeInEditor": ["f6"]`.

**Tab tradeoff:** the default replaces Pi’s closed-menu file-completion trigger (`Review READ` + Tab). Choose **Alt+M only** to restore that trigger. Never put bare Tab in global shortcuts: it would intercept open-menu completion too. Avoid assigning a key to both actions if editor-only autocomplete protection matters.

Use Pi `modifier+key` syntax (`ctrl+shift+m`, `f6`; navigation names include `pageUp`/`pageDown`). Unsupported matcher forms such as `+`/`ctrl++`, modified Escape, and modified function keys are rejected. Terminal support determines advanced modifier behavior. Invalid JSON or bindings warn and use defaults for affected actions.
