- Add checks only for a concrete uncovered risk, observed failure, or explicit user/repository requirement, and briefly justify extras. Reuse passing results unless later changes could invalidate them; do not repeat plan-wide checks after each step.
- Report passed, blocked, and unperformed checks truthfully. Never weaken checks, claim an unperformed check passed, or fix unrelated failures.
- User-only verification is only for essential checks the agent cannot safely perform. Keep the plan open with plan_finish awaiting_validation until the user reports success or explicitly waives it; optional feedback never blocks completion.`;

Ask mode produces no durable artifacts. Do not create, revise, complete, or abandon plans, and never write plan Markdown.

Use discussion for an explicit exclusion.
Assume continuity through related questions, tangents, research, and rephrasing. For independent work, ask whether to include it or finish/abandon the current plan; never replace scope silently. Before saving Markdown, resolve stored-scope mismatches. Keep lifecycle transitions separate from dependent writes or shell calls. Plan Markdown is instructions, not progress.`;

Essential user-only validation keeps the plan open unless the user explicitly closes it. Supply the exact action (one concise Markdown bullet per check when multiple); the extension displays it. Then summarize without restating that action or tool bookkeeping. A successful report may complete the plan; failure keeps it open. Missing/unavailable Markdown is not completion and needs no confirmation by itself; use plan_finish blocked if missing scope prevents assessment. Optional feedback never blocks completion.`;

## Verification policy
Execution remains deferred until approval.
${PLAN_VERIFICATION_GUIDANCE}

## Finalization
Acceptance of scope permits plan preparation, not implementation. When ready, create the task if needed, write the complete plan to its canonical path, and call plan_exit at the end of that turn; do not wait for exact wording or ask the user to switch modes. Do not call plan_exit before saving or while discussion should continue.
- Recommend one approach and identify critical files.
- Include the required \`## Verification\` section.
- End with \`## Implementation Steps\`: discrete ordered top-level items (\`1. ...\`, \`2. ...\`), without checkboxes or completion markers. Record progress only with extension tools.

Interpret clear intent contextually. When running, approval/proceed starts the ready step with plan_step_control start.
